*** Laboratory

Our first efforts include installing the buggy version of ls provided by
Coreutils 7.6:

$ mkdir ~/Desktop/assignment3
$ cd ~/Desktop/assignment3
-- creates an assignment3 directory that will be used for all assignment
related files

$ wget ftp://
ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
$ mkdir ~/
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz" and unzipped
the tar file with "tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz". Meanwhile, I created
a directory named coreutilsinstall in the home directory
("mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall"), where the new coreutils 7.6 will be installed.
Going back to the coreutils-7.6 directory, I ran the configure script
with an option to install coreutils at ~/coreutilsInstall: "./configure
--prefix="/u/eng/class/classkud/coreutilsInstall"" (the prefix flag
requires an absolute path, can use the pwd command to figure out
the absolute path of the current directory). After ./configure
created the Makefile, I ran 'make; make install' to install the
package. In ~/coreutilsInstall, we now can see three directories
created, namely "bin", "lib" and "share". The buggy executable
is contained in bin. While in ~/coreutilsInstall/bin, we can run:

$ ./ls -l /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 942200 2017-02-15 04:37 /bin/bash

$ ls -l /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 942200 Feb 15  2017 /bin/bash

As we expect, with the current locale set to 'en_US.UTF-8'
for all settings, we get the buggy YYYY-MM-DD format instead
of the Unix traditional format.
